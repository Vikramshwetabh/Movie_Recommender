# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on specific keywords and director names. The system leverages a comprehensive dataset from TMDB (The Movie Database) consisting of 5000 movies and their corresponding credits.

## Features
- Utilizes an extensive dataset with attributes such as budget, genres, homepage, keywords, language, overview, popularity, production details, release date, tagline, title, and vote counts.
- Merges movie data with credits using movie IDs for enriched information.
- Provides recommendations based on specific movie keywords and director names.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - ast
  - NLTK

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vikramshwetabh/Movie_Recommender.git
   
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries:**
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Place the `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` files in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` and `model_creation.ipynb` notebooks to preprocess the data and create the recommendation model.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook handles data cleaning, merging, and preprocessing.

2. **Model Creation:**
   - The `model_creation.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to build and train the recommendation model.

3. **Recommendation:**
   - Use the `recommender.py` script in the `src/` directory to generate movie recommendations based on input keywords and director names.

## Future Work
- Create and deploy a web page to host the Movie Recommender System, making it accessible for everyone to use and enjoy.
